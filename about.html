    <p>My name is Haoran Sun, and my English name is Calvin. I live in Zibo City, Shandong Province, China, and this is my first time doing a website. It feels good, my theme is about games and technology. What kind of impact will game technology bring to us? Maybe it will be slowly revealed in the next ten or twenty years.Of course my favorite things are:<ul>
        <li>Playing game</li>
        <li>Playing soccer</li>
        <li>Listening music</li>
        <li>Drving and Traveling</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Finally, I hope everyone can pay more attention to <em>Game technology!</em></p>
