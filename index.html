            <p><div class="Game-Technology"></div> The Game Technology for Health (GT4H) Network brings together knowledge and expertise about serious gaming for health benefits from different research groups across Departments and Faculties at NTNU. The aim of the network is to connect researchers and professionals both within and outside NTNU that develop or use game technology for health, in order to deliver high quality research and advance our knowledge at the best value possible.Representatives from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health trying the Playpulse tank game when visiting the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging.

            <p>Game Technology 4 Health (GT4H) is a network supported by NTNU Health.At NTNU, several expert teams are already working at the scientific forefront with exergaming, training apps, serious games, and integration with VR/AR technology. By broadening current collaborations and strengthening the network, NTNU is perfectly positioned to become nationally leading in this area.Game technology has developed tools to stimulate people to be active, provide instructions and feedback to patients, and maintain motivation and adherence.</p>

                    Playing a game can be defined as an activity that someone engages in for amusement. We play games because it's fun; it increases brain function, practices cognitive skills and releases serotonin, the happy chemical. As technology has advanced, the thrill and allure of playing games has only increased, with more visual stimulus, creativity, and satisfaction.

                    What is game technology? Game technology, or gametech, refers to dedicated solutions and services that are used throughout a game's lifecycle and are built especially for the purpose of game development. This is in contrast to products which can be used by game developers but weren't built with them in mind.

For example, training program Osso VR helps surgeons get access to information in real time via a virtual reality headset, alongside tools that enable them to assess how to perform surgery. “Osso VR is 230 percent more efficient than traditional methods,” the Washington Post says. Developed just a few years ago, it's now used to train over a thousand surgeons a month worldwide.

        <p>3D scanning and facial recognition technology allows systems to actually create your likeness in the gaming world (so you can create a custom avatar that looks just like you), or to inventively transfer your own expressions to other digital creations. On top of that, the Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera could allow developers to create games that adapt to the emotions of the gamer by scanning 78 different points on a person's face. For example, a few grimaces at your game screen means the system would dial down the game's difficulty instantly.</p>

        <p>Facial recognition is an exciting technology used for accomplishing a wide range of objectives like making online payments, unlocking phones, finding missing people, smarter advertising, and video games. While video game developers and gamers have welcomed the technology's use, experts (including gaming enthusiasts) are concerned about its privacy implications.</p>
