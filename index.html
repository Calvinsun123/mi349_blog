            <p>The Game Technology for Health (GT4H) Network brings together knowledge and expertise about serious gaming for health benefits from different research groups across Departments and Faculties at NTNU. The aim of the network is to connect researchers and professionals both within and outside NTNU that develop or use game technology for health, in order to deliver high quality research and advance our knowledge at the best value possible.Representatives from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health trying the Playpulse tank game when visiting the Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging.

            <p>Game Technology 4 Health (GT4H) is a network supported by NTNU Health.At NTNU, several expert teams are already working at the scientific forefront with exergaming, training apps, serious games, and integration with VR/AR technology. By broadening current collaborations and strengthening the network, NTNU is perfectly positioned to become nationally leading in this area.Game technology has developed tools to stimulate people to be active, provide instructions and feedback to patients, and maintain motivation and adherence.</p>

            <blockquote><p>As the Federal government has taken an increased role in
                supporting the adoption of health information technology
                new opportunities have been created to use information
                to support consumer engagement, education, disease
                management, and care delivery. Games offer a uniquely
                valuable tool for taking complex health data and making
                it meaningful and actionable to patients across a variety
                of demographics and health states.The field of health games is going through a combinatorial explosion—where declining technology costs, growing
                clinical and professional interest in games, and an increasingly refined understanding of what makes health games
                work are shaping a variety of trends that are shaping the landscape for health games. The following is a summary of
                some of the key trends identified by participants.</p></blockquote>

        <p>3D scanning and facial recognition technology allows systems to actually create your likeness in the gaming world (so you can create a custom avatar that looks just like you), or to inventively transfer your own expressions to other digital creations. On top of that, the Intel® RealSense™ 3D camera could allow developers to create games that adapt to the emotions of the gamer by scanning 78 different points on a person's face. For example, a few grimaces at your game screen means the system would dial down the game's difficulty instantly.</p>

        <p>Facial recognition is an exciting technology used for accomplishing a wide range of objectives like making online payments, unlocking phones, finding missing people, smarter advertising, and video games. While video game developers and gamers have welcomed the technology's use, experts (including gaming enthusiasts) are concerned about its privacy implications.</p>
